1) Hero: make it sharper + more SWE-forward

Right now: “Software Developer | Financial Data Analyst” + general passion text.

Change to:

Headline: “Software Engineer (Full-Stack / Backend)” (put finance as a secondary line if you want)

1–2 sentence value prop with proof: what you build + what you optimize (reliability, data integrity, performance, clean architecture)

Add 2 CTAs (buttons):

View Projects

Resume (PDF)

Add quick credibility chips under the CTAs:

“Java / Spring Boot • React • SQL • Docker”

“Built data pipelines + web apps”

“Open to US remote (US citizen)”

This instantly tells recruiters you’re SWE-first and removes “split identity” confusion.

2) About: rewrite from “passionate” → “evidence”

Your About reads like a student bio. Replace with 4–6 lines like:

what you build (systems/web apps/pipelines)

what you care about (correctness, maintainability, data integrity)

what you’ve shipped (2–3 concrete examples tied to your projects)

what you’re looking for (SWE roles, backend/full-stack)

Keep pickleball mention, but as context for products you shipped, not as the centerpiece.

3) Skills: drop the percentages, add real signals

Percent bars are a red flag because they’re subjective.

Replace “Technical Proficiency 90%/85%…” with:

Core: Java (Spring Boot), TypeScript/JavaScript, React, SQL

Also: Node.js, Python, Docker, Postgres, Prisma, REST, Testing (JUnit/Jest), CI/CD

Practices: Clean architecture, API design, schema migrations, observability basics

If you want a visual, use “strong / working / familiar” instead of numbers.

4) Experience: you need this section to exist (even if short)

Your nav has Experience but your pasted content shows only Education.

Add:

SAP Fioneer — Software Engineer (Jan 2022–Aug 2022)

WeMeta — Software Engineer (Jul 2021–Feb 2023)

Web Dev / Full Stack — (Dec 2019–Mar 2023, Whitby)

For each: 2–4 bullets, each in Impact format:

“Built X… resulting in Y… using Z”
Even if you don’t have perfect metrics, use scale/throughput/latency/complexity.

5) Projects: upgrade from descriptions → case studies (biggest win)

Your project blurbs are good, but you need proof + engineering decisions.

For each featured project, add:

Problem

What I built

Key technical decisions (2–3 bullets)

Results / impact (numbers if possible)

Buttons: Live Demo • GitHub • Read Case Study

Pickleball Session Manager (make it your flagship full-stack case study)

Add details like:

data model + migrations (Prisma)

balancing algorithm approach

rating changes logic

auth / roles (if any)

deployment (Vercel/Replit/etc.)

Market Data Pipeline (make it your flagship backend case study)

Add:

ingest flow + idempotency

caching strategy + why

DB schema choices (your normalized indicator table is a great talking point)

API endpoints + examples

tests + performance notes

Mind Map / HomeServer

These are fine, but they read weaker unless you add technical depth + screenshots. If they’re not strong, demote them to “Other Projects”.

Also add screenshots/GIFs. Portfolios without visuals feel unfinished.

6) Contact: fix credibility issues + friction

“I’ll get back to you within 24 hours.” → feels like marketing. Make it simpler.

Your form should either:

actually send (EmailJS/Resend/etc.) and show success state, or

remove it and just show email + LinkedIn.
A broken form hurts trust.

7) Add 2 small sections that dramatically improve conversion
A) “What I’m looking for”

1 short line:

“Backend / Full-Stack SWE roles • Java/Spring Boot or TS/Node • Remote US”

B) “Proof / Links”
